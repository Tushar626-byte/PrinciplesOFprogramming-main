# Principles of Programming - Weekly Lab Codes

Welcome to the **Principles of Programming** repository! 🎉  
In this repository, I will be uploading code solutions that I work on during my lab classes every **Friday**. These programs cover various fundamental topics in programming and are designed to enhance my skills and understanding as I progress in my second year of **BTCSE**.

## 📅 Weekly Progress
Each Friday, new code will be added. Check out the directory structure below to follow along!

### Table of Contents
| Week | Topic |
|------|-------|
| Week 1 | Basic Input/Output |
| Week 2 | Control Structures |
| Week 3 | Functions |
| Week 4 | Arrays and Pointers |
| Week 5 | File Handling |
*(More weeks will be added as the semester progresses!)*

## 💻 Topics Covered
- **Variables & Data Types**: Understanding and implementing various data types.
- **Control Flow**: Loops, conditionals, and branching.
- **Functions**: Modular programming using user-defined functions.
- **Arrays and Pointers**: Working with arrays and memory management.
- **File I/O**: Reading from and writing to files.

## 🎯 Purpose
This repository serves as a learning hub where I track my progress and improve my programming skills. Each file is a reflection of the knowledge I gained during the week's lab classes.

## 🔧 How to Run the Code
